# Web-Scrapping-in-R
I worked on this project in the course R Programming for Data Science by IBM. 

## Scenario
In this scenario, you will play the role of a data analyst who has recently
joined the data science team of a news channel.
Your channel’s documentary team channel’s recently accepted an assignment to create a feature story on global COVID-19 testing by country and they need some data-driven insights
from your team.Your team has been using Jupyter Notebook,
which is a powerful and easy-to-use platform for data analysis and data science tasks.
As a new team member, your team leader has assigned this task to you. You need to leverage your R
skills to acquire the relevant datasets, as well as process and analyze them.

## Lab Instructions

In this final project, you will webscrape a global COVID-19 dataset from a public wiki page, and conduct various data analysis tasks on the data set.
